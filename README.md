# Chirpy

**Twitter-like application built as part of Boot.dev's "Learn Web Servers" course**

This is a REST API backend written in Go, using
[Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) as the routing library and
[jwt-go](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) for JWT-based authentication.

**Note**: While the course assignments were primarily concerned with validating
the responses in terms of status codes and JSON bodies, I took some extra
effort to make a relatively organized architecture. (TODO: describe in more
detail after completion)
